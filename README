Compile program by issuing command "make".
Clean up by issuing command "make clean".

Run program using ./master (-h for usage help).

WARNING: Program does not compile and does not run. Various errors occur when attempting to compile.

Note: Could not get shared memory to work and thus was stuck on that part and could not move past. Attempted what I thought was how to do other steps but could not test as shared memory would not work.
